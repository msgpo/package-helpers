 This email from Steve Moshier, the copyright owner of cephes, to Helen 
 Faulkner (Debian maintainer of labplot), and other interested parties 
 (labplot and grace authors, grace maintainer and labplot sponsor), confirms 
 that we may release labplot with cephes licensed under the GPL.

 This is fine with me.  To acknowedge your terms explicily,
 how about augmenting the permission to read something like
 the following --
 .
   This software is derived from the Cephes Math Library. It is
   incorporated herein, and licensed in accordance with DFSG,
   by permission of the author.
 .
 .
 If you are trying to get me to suggest a specific form for your
 license, then from looking at Debian programs such as dpkg it seems to
 me that you would find the GPL to be appropriate and the permission
 statement could reference one of the GPL documents instead of DFSG.
 Alternatively, the packages you have been talking about distributing
 with Debian presumably come with some sort of licenses and it would
 make sense to propose those licenses.
