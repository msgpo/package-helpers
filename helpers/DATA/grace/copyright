   This is fine with me.  To acknowedge your terms explicily,
   how about augmenting the permission to read something like
   the following --

     This software is derived from the Cephes Math Library. It is
     incorporated herein, and licensed in accordance with DFSG,
     by permission of the author.


   If you are trying to get me to suggest a specific form for your
   license, then from looking at Debian programs such as dpkg it seems to
   me that you would find the GPL to be appropriate and the permission
   statement could reference one of the GPL documents instead of DFSG.
   Alternatively, the packages you have been talking about distributing
   with Debian presumably come with some sort of licenses and it would
   make sense to propose those licenses.
